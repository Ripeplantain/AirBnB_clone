# AirBnB_clone
This is my first group portofolio project for alx-software engineering program

Description of the project

The ALX B&B clone wll sums up the implementation of my four months of studies at the ALX School - the fullstack software engineering program. The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:

    . A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
    . A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
    . A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
    . An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.
